  # It appears these get duplicated rather than overriding.  The hope was to use this as a counter to the
  # `required_instructions` section, but perhaps it defines the `line_rules` map.  It would be great to either be able
  # to set `required_instructions` to a 0 value or have an `invalid_instructions` section?
